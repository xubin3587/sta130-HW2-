When there is a car behind the door chosen by the contestant, the host can choose one of the other two doors at random; When there is no car behind the door chosen by the contestant, the host has only one door to choose from, so use next directly to make sure. The replacement door selection is also implemented by a single line of code, which directly finds the remaining unselected and unoclocked doors."
